//! Reading the library that Rekordbox 5 keeps in `datafile.edb`.
//!
//! The library holds its rows in the same format as a device export, down to the DeviceSQL
//! strings and the offset tables of a track row, so the row parsers of the [`crate::pdb`] module
//! read them unchanged. What differs is the container: the rows are not held in the pages of a
//! `export.pdb`, but in a flat heap, with each row preceded by a tag naming its type.
//!
//! How that heap is indexed is not worked out yet, so the rows are found by looking for those
//! tags rather than by following an index. That is enough to read a library, with two
//! consequences worth knowing: rows that Rekordbox has deleted but not overwritten are found as
//! well, and a row whose type is not known is not found at all. Neither keeps a library from
//! being read, but it does mean the counts here can exceed what Rekordbox shows.
