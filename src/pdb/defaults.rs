//! Default content of the tables of a device export.
//!
//! Rekordbox fills a handful of tables with the same content in every export, even in one that
//! has no tracks in it: the colors a track can be labelled with, the columns tracks can be
//! browsed by, and the menu those columns appear in. Players read these, so an export built from
//! scratch needs them.
//!
//! The content here was taken from an export written by Rekordbox, which
//! `tests/test_pdb_create.rs` compares against byte for byte.
